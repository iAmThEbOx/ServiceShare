## Software Architecture 
- REST
    - REST API
        - REST stands for Representational State Transfer, all that really means is that a REST API is the pathway that connects a web client to a server via HTTP requests
    - REST Constraints
        - Client-Server
        - Cache
        - Stateless
        - Uniform Contract
        - Layered System
        - Code-On-Demand (request gets executed immediately)
    - Design Principles
        - Communication remains stateless
        - requests are made via HTTP protocols
        - each resource is identified by unique URLs

- Resource
    - use-case specific data that the API distributes/transports within the app's network
- Layered System
    - A layered system creates more layers between the server and the web client within the microservice

- Requests
    - Get, Post, Put, Delete

- Storage Methodology
    - CRUD
        - Create, Read, Update, Delete
